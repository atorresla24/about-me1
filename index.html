  <p>
 My name is Brentice Loper. I am twenty nine years old and I was in the USN (United states Navy). I am currently in college while attending Code Fellows and I am loving every minute of it. 
 <br>
 <p>I love playing video games, sleeping, and procrastinating. Don't judge me, that's just the way it is.</p>
